# intuitiveAlgorithms-Sezgisel-

<p><b>
  Algorithms can be used as base algorithms that might be
extended to be competitive. Of course, this implies that even the base algorithms
should be able to solve real life instances of reasonable size.<br>Therefore, we emphasize that algorithms are designed to be applicable in real life instance and yield
good theoretical bounds at the same time.<br>Perhaps you think each case study also includes some arguments can be considered intuitive.For this reason,each case study contains a section that how to respective algorithms can be implemented
and how they perform on real life instances.<br>My goal is give to some algorithms where intuitive algorithms are both fast in terms of a traditional analysis but at
the same time also efficient on real life instances.
<br>Also I believe that the increasing importance solve hard computation problems exactly ,in computational biology or medicine,justifies this approach.
