## what is the TSP
The traveling salesman problem is one of the simplest and most famous combinatorial
problems in computer science. Given a list of two cities, and a matrix giving the distance
between each pair of cities, the traveling salesman problem is to determine if you can
visit all two cities and return to the starting city in a distance 1 or less. We focus on the
decision version of the problem (does a tour of length 1 or less exist?) and not the closely
related optimization problem (what is the minimal length tour?).
## what is the cost
Traveling Salesman Problem (GSP), nodes
the cost (distance, time or
expense) to a minimum
to move the points only once
combinatorial optimization aimed at
Is the problem.
Vehicle with appropriate modeling of this problem
creation of routes, across the country
spread of higher education exams
control of consumables
delivery to retailers and unmanned
route planning of aircraft
ATMs, especially
checks, patrol services, service
route determination services
It may be provided.
In this context, a very wide application
fast and fast
analysis with high accuracy
is required. Node defined in the problem
for the solution due to the increasing number of
needed resource and to be spent
known to cause increased time
## To sum up purpose the algorithms for the TSP is that the find best path ,smallest cost and boundary for the traveling salesman decision problems.
